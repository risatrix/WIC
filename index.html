            <h1>Act I</h1>

            <p class="dir">The stage is dark and silent. A door is faintly visible stage left.</p>

            <p class="dir">A woman walks onstage, dressed in a long tunic with a cloak slung over it. A veil conceals her face and a false beard hangs from her neck. A laurel wreath dangles from one wrist, hitting the walking stick she carries in her hand. Balancing these items carefully, she uses her other hand to hold an Aladdin-style lamp in front of her, with the flame rising from its snout. Her feet are clad in ostentatiously large boots.</p>

            <p class="dir">She holds lamp aloft and addresses it with exaggerated solemnity.<a href="#1" class="fn">1</a></p>

            <div class="role">PRAXAGORA</div> 
            <p>O bright eye of clay-cast lamp, Grandest invention of artisans wise!<br>
            Allow your pedigree to be revealed:<br>
            The mighty potter threw you on his wheel<br> 
            (<em>squinting at the snout</em>) <br>
            Your nostrils became a lighthouse of sun. <br>
            (<em>waving it about</em>) <br>
            Send out the secret signals of your flame.<br>
            'Tis you we trust in pursuit of Aphrodite's ways...<br>
            On the bedstand you sit while we try to get laid.<br>
            (<em>bringing the lamp eye level</em>, <em>she chides it affectionately</em>) <br>
            Your watchful eye cannot be banned From rooms with bodies banging.<br> 
            You light up our thighs in bloom You singe hairs from our flow'ring hoo-hahs.<a href="#2" class="fn">2</a></p>

            <p class="dir">She illustrates with appropriate gestures, ending with flourish.</p><p>

            </p><p>You conspire to 'lift' the gifts of Bacchus, Springing wine jugs from pantry prison.</p> 

            <p class="dir">She pirouettes dramatically, bowing to the lamp.</p>

            <p class="dir">She pulls the veil off her head and drops the tragic posturing --but she's still talking to the lamp.</p>

            <p>(<em>fondly</em>) And you do all that without blabbing to the neighbors.</p> 

            <p class="dir">She puts down the wreath and walking stick as she cradles the lamp in her other hand.</p>

            <p>For that, <em>you</em> get to know about the the plans we devised at the Scira festival.<a href="#3" class="fn">3</a> My friends should've been here by now, but not a single one has come and it's almost dawn already. Congress will convene any second now. We've got to get seats there, and — as Phyromachus<a href="#4" class="fn">4</a> once said — "ladies must be seated without attracting attention." </p>

            <p class="dir">She looks around.</p>

            <p>So what the hell's going on?! Maybe they didn't get ahold of the fake beards like they said they would? Or, maybe they had a hard time stealing their husbands' coats without getting caught? (<em>straining to see</em>) But wait! I see a light up ahead! I'd better hide. Whoever's coming might be a man.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora steps back into the shadows.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Several women approach from various points offstage. They creep through the darkness without lamps, but otherwise they are wearing the same get-up as Praxagora — though perhaps they don't pull it off as elegantly. Some trip over their boots; others haven't draped their cloaks quite right.</p>

            <div class="role">WOMAN ONE</div> 
            <p>(<em>to the others)</em> It's time to go—I just heard the second cock-a-doodle-doo.</p><p>

            </p><p class="dir">Praxagora sighs with exasperation and steps forward.</p>

            <div class="role">PRAXAGORA</div> 
            <p><em>I</em> was the one up all night waiting for you guys.</p>

            <p class="dir">She looks stage left, expectantly.</p>

            <p>I guess I'd better get my neighbor. I'll knock lightly on her door so her husband won't hear and she can sneak out.</p> 

            <p class="dir">She creeps steathily stage left, crouching so as not to be seen. She barely taps. A woman's head appears from behind the door.</p>

            <div class="role">WOMAN TWO</div>
            <p>(<em>whispering loudly</em>) Just a second!</p>

            <p class="dir">The neighbor's head disappears for a moment. Then she appears in full, wearing the same get-up as the other women. She runs as delicately as possible in her boots, tripping across the stage to meet Praxagora. </p>

            <p>I was putting on my shoes when I heard you knock. I swear I wasn't asleep — my husband's a navy guy,<a href="#5" class="fn">5</a>once he sets sail he "rows" me all night. I couldn't steal his coat 'til just now.</p>

            <p class="dir">Praxagora cocks her head, as though she hears something. She turns stage right.</p>
            <div class="role">PRAXAGORA</div>

            <p>Oh look, I see Kleinaréte…and Sostráte…and Philainéte.<a href="#6" class="fn">6</a></p> 

            <p class="dir">More strangely attired women approach from stage right. Praxagora addresses the newcomers sternly.</p>

            <p>Why didn't you get here sooner? (<em>shaking her finger</em>) Don't your remember our bet? We swore the last to show up would have to pay up: three jugs of wine and a bag of chickpeas!<a href="#7" class="fn">7</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Woman One points and laughs at a woman having trouble with her shoes.</p>

            <!--Oct 12-->
            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>(<em>to Praxagora</em>) Hey, do you see Melistíche, plodding along in her husband's shoes?<a href="#8" class="fn">8</a></p> 

            <p>PRAXAGORA She's not too quick....But that's not her husband's fault.</p> 

            <p class="dir">A woman staggers onstage with a torch in her right hand, and almost falls flat on her face as she trips over her boots. She shuffles sheepishly to the back of the crowd.</p>

            <p class="dir">Woman One barely conceals a laugh.</p>

            WOMAN ONE 

            <p>And do you see the barkeep's wife, Booze-istrata,<a href="#9" class="fn">9</a> over there? </p> 

            <p class="dir">More women enter. Woman Two looks them over critically.</p>

            WOMAN TWO

            <p>Yeah! And I see Philodoretus' wife, and Chairetades' wife,<a href="#10" class="fn">10</a> and lots of others — the city's finest!</p>

            WOMAN THREE

            <p>(<em>slightly out of breath</em>) Sweetie, I tried to sneak out, but my husband stuffed himself with sardines. He was up (<em>she shudders with disgust</em>) <em>belching </em>all night. I had the worst time getting away.<a href="#11" class="fn">11</a></p> 

            <p class="dir">Other women nod sympathetically and mutter in agreement. They're just starting to compare war stories when Praxagora gestures for silence.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>OK, everyone. Please take your seats. We established our goals at the festival for Athena last summer. Now that you're all here, I need to find out if you've achieved your objectives.</p>

            <p class="dir">A woman thrusts up her hand eagerly.</p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>(<em>breathlessly</em>) Ooo, I did! My armpits are scruffier than an overgrown shrub, just like we agreed. And then, whenever my husband was off at work, I oiled up my arms and legs and worshipped the sun all day. Look at my farmer's tan!<a href="#12" class="fn">12</a></p>

            <p class="dir">She shows off her tan proudly. The women mumur their approval.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Woman Two raises her hand just as eagerly, revealing an impressive shock of armpit hair. Some women gasp in horror.</p>

            WOMAN TWO

            <p>Me too! My razor? I chucked it right in the trash. I'm so stubbly, you'd think I was a man. Or at least a drag king.</p> 

            <p class="dir">The rest of the women look at her with a combination of admiration, disgust, and curiosity. Praxagora tries to bring their attention back to the task at hand. </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Speaking of which, (<em>holding her fake beard up</em>) do you all have your beards?? Remember, we all agreed to bring them.</p>

            <p class="dir">Woman One waves her beard in the air, still an eager beaver.</p>

            &gt;WOMAN ONE 
            <p>(<em>proudly</em>) Heck-a-te yeah.<a href="#13" class="fn">13</a>The one I've got's real nice! </p> 

            WOMAN TWO 
            <p>(<em>not to be outdone</em>) And mine's far better than Ol’ Longbeard’s!<a href="#14" class="fn">14</a>Arrrr!</p>

            <p class="dir">The two wave their beards competitively at each other. Praxagora ignores them andturns to the rest of the women.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>What about the rest of you? Do you have yours?</p> 

            <p class="dir">All the women nod; some say "yes" with varying degrees of enthusiasm.</p>

            WOMAN THREE 

            <p>(<em>to Praxagora</em>) Looks like they have them.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>approvingly</em>) Good. I see that you've met my expectations. You’ve managed to rustle up men’s shoes, staffs, and coats, just like we agreed.<a href="#15" class="fn">15</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Woman One can't help but brag as she brandishes an obscenely long rod.</p>

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>Even better, I nabbed the honorable Mr. Lame-ass's rod<a href="#16" class="fn">16</a>while he slept!</p> 

            <p class="dir">Some of the women touch the staff with approval. Woman Two inspects it thoroughly.</p>


            WOMAN TWO 
            <p>(<em>skeptically</em>) Is it that the one he leans on to fart?</p>

            <p class="dir">Several women snicker knowingly. Praxagora drops her authoritative façade for a moment.</p>

            <p class="dir">She turns away from the group and addresses the audience directly.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>conspiratorially</em>) Zeus Almighty, of all politicians that fart-monster should just put on a hundred-holed leather vest, and ride his cattle straight to hell!<a href="#17" class="fn">17</a></p>

            <p class="dir">She resumes her position of authority.</p>

            <p><em>(forcefully</em>) Anyhow, let's move on to the next item while it's still dark out.</p>

            <p class="dir">She squints at the sky.</p>

            <p>We don't have much time to prepare—Congress begins at daybreak.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Murmurs of agreement from the women.</p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>Yes, and we need to snag those front-row seats, the ones right across from the speaker’s podium.<a href="#18" class="fn">18</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Woman Two holds up a bundle of knitting.</p>

            &gt;WOMAN TWO 
            <p>Hey, look what I brought! Now I can knit<a href="#19" class="fn">19</a> while Congress gets started!</p> 
            <p class="dir">Praxagora turns to look at Woman Two, not believing what she has just heard.</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Knit, you idiot?</p>

            WOMAN TWO 

            <p>What? (<em>defensively</em>) By the chaste bosom of Artemis, don't you think I can knit and listen at the same time? My kids are practically naked!</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>disgustedly</em>) Great. Picture that. The whole point is to fit in with the men, and there you are knitting with your legs exposed.We'd be pretty screwed if some woman clambered over a full Congress like that and flashed her "Phromisius"<a href="#20" class="fn">20</a> But if we get there early enough, we can go "under cover".</p>

            <p class="dir">Praxagora demonstrates this by tightly wrapping the coat around her, concealing her body.</p>

            <p>And when we attach our beards and let 'em all hang out,who wouldn't think we’re men?</p>

            <p class="dir">She quickly pulls her beard up to cover her face, then puts it down.</p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>Right! (<em>pointing at the audience</em>) That guy Agyhrrius used to be a woman, but with 
            Pronomos's<a href="#21" class="fn">21</a> beard, he passes. And now look at him: he's in charge of the whole city!</p> 

            <p class="dir">he women laugh in agreement.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora draws herself up, speaking in an ostentatiously serious tone.</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p class="dir">Just like him, on this day, we must brave so brazen a feat.</p>

            <p class="dir">Her speech gains momentum.</p>

            <p>We must somehow seize the affairs of state and do something good for the city. Right now we're neither captains nor rowers on the ship of state.</p> 
            WOMAN ONE 

            <p>(<em>earnestly</em>) But wait, how can a bunch of harebrained women run Congress?? PRAXAGORA Best of all, I think. They say the best politicians got pounded most as interns.<a href="#22" class="fn">22</a> As it happens, getting screwed comes naturally to us! </p>

            <p class="dir">Woman One looks skeptical.</p>

            WOMAN ONE 

            <p>I’m not so sure. We still lack experience.</p>

            PRAXAGORA  

            <p>But that's exactly why we're here—to prepare for our moment in Congress. So you put on your beard right away. (<em>turning to the other women</em>) And the same goes for the rest of you. If you're planning on speaking in there, you'd better practice. </p>

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>Hon, which woman here doesn't already know how to talk?!</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>(<em>exasperated</em>) Just put on your beard and be a man already.</p> 

            <p class="dir">The women begin to put on their beards. Praxagora picks up her own laurel wreath.</p>

            <p>I'll keep my wreath and beard nearby, just in case I decide to speak.</p>

            <p class="dir">The women help each other put on the beards properly, straightening them and tying them tightly.</p>

            WOMAN TWO 

            <p>Hey, Praxagora! Come over here. It’s a nightmare! Check out how ridiculous this is!</p>

            PRAXAGORA  

            <p>What's so ridiculous?</p> 

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>(<em>in hysterics</em>) It's as if you stuck a beard on a seared squid!<a href="#23" class="fn">23</a></p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora sighs and stares blankly at the woman. Deciding she's not going to make progress with this one, she starts to the ritual that begins Congress. She walks solemnly around the women, then turns to a woman next to her.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Priestess, bring out the weasel!<a href="#24" class="fn">24</a></p>
             
            <p class="dir">The woman brings out a stuffed weasel. Praxagora takes it and waves it ceremonially. 
            She sets it aside.

            </p><p>(<em>calling Congress into session</em>) Everyone please come to the front.</p> 

            <p>(<em>to an errant woman</em>) You there! Stop talking.<a href="#25" class="fn">25</a>Come here and sit down.</p>

            <p class="dir">The woman does</p>

            <p>Who wishes to speak?</p>

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>I do.</p> 

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>Please put on the wreath.</p> 

            <p class="dir">The woman does.</p>

            <p>Good luck to you.</p>

            WOMAN ONE 


            <p class="dir">(<em>straightening her wreath</em>) All set.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>You may begin speaking.</p>

            WOMAN ONE 

            <p>What?! Without a drink?</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>A drink?!?!</p> 

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>Yes, a drink. (<em>with a flourish</em>) Why else would I put on this stupid wreath?<a href="#26" class="fn">26</a></p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora grabs the wreath from the woman's head.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Get out! You would have ruined us in there.</p> 

            WOMAN ONE 

            <p>Huh? Don't they drink in Congress? </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>disgusted</em>) You and your "don't they drink"…. </p>
            <p>WOMAN ONE</p>

            <p>By the <em>Jaeger</em>-mistress,<a href="#27" class="fn">27</a> I know they do — straight up! Their legislation is trashed and they vote like drunks. For Zeussakes, think about it. Politicians only pray if they're drinking.<a href="#28" class="fn">28</a> They abuse each other like winos, until the police drag out the biggest boozer... </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Go sit down. You're useless. </p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>(<em>grumbling to herself</em>) Zeus<a href="#29" class="fn">29</a> I wish I had never grown this damned beard. As it is, I'm about to die of thirst….</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Does anyone else wish to speak? </p>

            WOMAN TWO 

            <p>(<em>somewhat timidly</em>) I do. </p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Go ahead and put on the wreath.</p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora starts to worry that this isn't going to work. (<em>to herself, trying to bolster her own confidence</em>)</p> 

            <p>There’s no turning back now. </p> 

            <p class="dir">As the woman puts on the wreath, Praxagora decides to try more of a "coach" tactic.</p>

            <p>All right now, speak in a good manly fashion. (<em>gruffly</em>) Lean your weight on that stick.</p>

            WOMAN TWO

            <p>(<em>taking up a convincing politician’s tone</em>) My friends, I for my part would have preferred to sit by quietly, if only a senior member of Congress had in fact advised the best course of action. But as it is, I cannot allow these taverns of ill repute to keep filling their kegs — with water! I will not stand for this, by the Twins!<a href="#30" class="fn">30</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Caught up in excitement, she puts both hands to her breasts and drops her stick.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>By the Twins, you moron?! Have you lost your mind?</p> 

            WOMAN TWO 
            <p>What did I do? I didn't ask you for a drink?!</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Zeus Almighty, you’re supposed be a man, yet you swore on the Twins! <em>She sighs disappointedly and removes the wreath from the woman's head. </em>Otherwise, you spoke perfectly.</p>


            WOMAN TWO 
            <p>Oh man…ummm…."By Apollo"!?! </p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Just stop! I will not take another step towards Congress unless we are completely prepared.</p>

            WOMAN TWO

            <p>Give back the wreath. (<em>She grabs it.</em>) I want to speak again. (<em>with dignified resolve</em>) I believe I have perfected my speech.</p>

            <p class="dir">She composes herself and begins her speech again.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, ladies of the Congress…</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Ladies!? Again, you boob? You're talking to <em>men</em>!!</p>

            WOMAN TWO 

            <p>(<em>pointing to an audience member</em>) It’s because of him. (<em>gestures</em>) That twinkle toes Epigonos<a href="#31" class="fn">31</a> over there. I saw him and thought I was talking to women! </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>resignedly</em>) Go away, you, and sit down. Thanks to you all, now I have to take the wreath and do the job myself…</p>

            <p class="dir">She does. She puts on the wreath, then holds her arms out with palms up.</p>

            <p>I begin by praying to the gods for their help with bringing our deliberations to success.</p>

            <p class="dir">She pauses dramatically.<a href="#32" class="fn">32</a></p>

            <p>My fellow Congressmen, I am distressed. My stake in this country is the same as yours, and yet my heart is burdened by the current state of affairs. How is it that we constantly elect criminals to office? If one of these men chooses to act responsibly for just one day, he will be twice as corrupt for the next ten. Say we turn to another for guidance --his misconduct will, no doubt, be even worse.</p> 

            <p class="dir">She pauses dramatically, again.</p>

            <p>Now, let me be clear, the prospect of giving advice to hardheaded Congressmen like you is daunting --daunting because, without fail, you fear men who take your side and chase after those who openly oppose you.</p> 

            <p>As we all know, before Congress existed at all, no one failed to recognize the corruption of a leader like Aghyrrius.<a href="#33" class="fn">33</a> But now that there is a Congress, anyone under the spell of money praises the system. Others denounce corruption and proclaim death as a punishment for greed, but they themselves are no less covetous.<a href="#34" class="fn">34</a></p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>By Aphrodite's nightie, that sounds great!</p>

            <p class="dir">Without missing a beat Praxagora turns to smack the woman with her wreath.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>You moron! You swore by Aphrodite?!?! Great move, if you said that in Congress.</p> 

            WOMAN ONE 
            <p>But I wouldn't.</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Don't do it now, then. <em>She resumes a dignified oratorical posture. </em></p> 

            <p>At the time when we deliberated about joining our allies in war, some were saying that our city would be destroyed if there was no alliance.<a href="#35" class="fn">35</a> But as soon as we forged the alliance, everyone was outraged, and the politician who urged this plan<a href="#36" class="fn">36</a> immediately went into hiding.</p> 

            <p>Next we're told that we need a surge in naval forces—an attractive option to the desperate, perhaps, but not to the rich or the farmers attached to their land.<a href="#37" class="fn">37</a></p>

            <p>As it is, one moment you are enraged at the Corinthian anti-war faction and they at you; the next, they are brilliant and so are you.<a href="#38" class="fn">38</a> And how is it that a war-monger from Argos is stupid, but our own Hieronymus is wise?<a href="#39" class="fn">39</a></p>

            <p>At last a chance for peace peeks through, but then that hawk Thrasybulus ruins it; he is angry because he was not consulted.<a href="#40" class="fn">40</a></p>

            WOMAN ONE

            <p>(<em>referring to Praxagora</em>) Wow, that <em>man </em>is clever!</p>

            <p class="dir">Praxagora winks encouragingly.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Now you're talkin'!</p>

            <p class="dir">She returns to her speech.</p>

            <p>Men of Congress, this is your fault. You are to blame because, even though you receive your paycheck from this government, each of you is intent on personal gain. You have shown no concern for the public good. You have thrown it under the chariot, just like Aesimus.<a href="#41" class="fn">41</a></p> 

            <p>The choice is ours. If you are willing to follow my advice, we can still save the city. (<em>Pause</em>) I propose that we hand our city over to the women --the women who have, in fact, already acted as governors and treasurers in our own homes.</p><p> 

            </p><p class="dir">The women cheer loudly.</p>

            WOMAN ONE
            <p>(<em>pounding her staff rhythmically on the ground</em>) Right on, right on, by Zeus, right on!!</p>

            WOMAN TWO 
            <p>(<em>also pounding her staff</em>) More, more! Speak on, good man!</p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora, now caught up in her own successful delivery, takes it over top. She settles the crowd with her hands.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Thank you, thank you. Please. Let me explain. Women surpass us in every way. To begin with, they, <em>every last one of them</em>, dye wool the old-fashioned way --in hot water! You would never see a single woman doing something new. The Athenian city, on the other hand, does not know the meaning of the word "tradition". Even if a practice is useful, the city can't stop itself from trying out some strange alternative.</p>

            <p>But women...</p> 
            <p>
            Women sit down to shuck and roast corn, same as always.<br> 
            They use their heads for transporting goods, same as always.<br> 
            They dutifully host the state fair<a href="#42" class="fn">42</a> each year, same as always.<br> 
            They bake cakes, same as always.<br> 
            They harass their husbands....</p> 

            <p class="dir">Praxagora waits expectantly. The chorus of women catches on and chimes in from now on.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p class="dir">The women cheer even more loudly. Praxagora takes advantage of the laughter to return to a more serious point.</p>
             
            <p>Now is the time to act, men of Congress. Let us not engage in needless debate about handing the city over to the women, nor enquire what they intend to do. Rather, let us simply allow them to govern, taking these few facts into consideration: as mothers, their top priority will be to save our soldiers, their sons. Who, I ask, would be quicker to send provisions than a mother? And when it comes to managing money, a wife is the most resourceful of all. Once they're in power, we won't have to worry about women being cheated — women spend their whole lives cheating others.</p>

            <p>I could go on, but I will stop there. Consider that if you adopt my plan, the rest of your lives will be spent in carefree bliss.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>During the war my husband and I were living in the refugee camps near city hall.<a href="#43" class="fn">43</a> I could hear the Congressmen debating from there and, after a while, I figured out how to speak like a politician.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>I'll tell him he's a psycho...<a href="#46" class="fn">46</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Zeus, man, you know, she wasn't actually there…She slipped out last night.</p>

            <p class="dir">He strikes a tragic pose<a href="#63" class="fn">63</a>—at least as much as he can while still squatting.</p>

            <p>I fear there is some scheme afoot.</p>

            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>By Poseidon's sea shell collection, the same thing happened to me! That wife of mine took off with my favorite coat. (<em>incredulously</em>) That’s not all, she took my shoes! I can’t find the damned things anywhere.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>You too, by the grape-clusters of Dionysus?! I couldn’t find my dress shoes either—but I still had to shit. So I crammed my feet into these little frilly pumps...</p>

            <p class="dir">The neighbor bends down suspiciously to inspect the slippers. Blepyros shifts his squat to one side and sticks his foot out.</p> 

            <p>(<em>by way of explanation</em>) ...to keep from shitting in my blanket.</p> 

            <p class="dir">The neighbor looks incredulous</p>

            <p>What?....It was clean.</p>

            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>Well then, what the hell’s going on? Maybe one of her friends invited her over for breakfast?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Yeah, you might be right.</p>

            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>She’s not some skank, as far as I know.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros strains. The neighbor observes.</p>

            <p>Wow, it looks like you’re trying to tug some sort of rope outta there.</p>

            <p class="dir">He mimes checking his watch and starts backing away slowly.</p>

            <p>Well...it looks like it’s time for me to go to Congress. If I can find my cloak, that is. It’s my only good one.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>still squatting</em>) I’ll go too, as soon as I relieve myself. But right now it feels like there’s a friggin' potato plugging up my cornhole!<a href="#64" class="fn">64</a></p>

            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>Hah. Let’s hope this blockade doesn’t last as long as the one against the islands!<a href="#65" class="fn">65</a></p>

            <p class="dir">The neighbor exits. Blepyros, now alone, makes a face and grunts with extra effort.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>By the grapes of Dionysus, I’m really stopped up. What I am going to do? It’s not just my current state – (<em>getting more and more frantic</em>) what about next time I eat? Where will the turds go? This tater tot from Spud-opolis<a href="#66" class="fn">66</a> has my silo yammed-up!</p>

            <p class="dir">He turns to the audience, still in squatting position.</p>

            <p>Can any of you get me a doctor? A specialist? Anyone a proctologist out there?<a href="#67" class="fn">67</a></p>

            <p>(<em>pointing</em>) Oh, I know. There’s Amynon. He’s an ass man.<a href="#68" class="fn">68</a>(<em>disappointedly</em>) Oh, right. He’s in the closet.<a href="#69" class="fn">69</a>

            </p><p class="dir">A new idea hits him</p> 

            <p>Someone call Antisthenes STAT. I've heard those groans...that guy sure knows what a loaded asshole wants.<a href="#70" class="fn">70</a></p>

            <p class="dir">He falls to his knees howling.</p>

            <p>Goddess of natural childbirth!<a href="#71" class="fn">71</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Dawn is just starting to break. Blepyros doesn't notice his neighbor Chremes approach.</p>

            CHREMES

            <p>Hey, you.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros continues howling. Chremes watches him writhe for a moment.</p>

            <p>(<em>more loudly</em>) What are you doing? (<em>disgusted</em>) You're not taking a shit are you? 

            </p><p class="dir">Blepyros stops howling. He looks up at Chremes. Waits a moment. Rises to his knees.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Who, me?</p>

            <p class="dir">He stands up.</p>

            <p>Technically, no.</p>

            <p class="dir">Chremes eyes Blepyros' get-up.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Is that you wife's nightie you've got on?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>exasperated</em>) It was dark. I happened to grab this. (<em>changing the subject</em>) So...where have you been? </p> 

            CHREMES 
            <p>Congress.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros looks at his nonexistent watch.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Is it over already?</p> 

            CHREMES 
            <p>For crying out loud—it was over by daybreak! They roped it off right away and --everloving Zeus! --left all of us slowpokes just standing there.<a href="#72" class="fn">72</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Did you get your three bucks, at least?<a href="#73" class="fn">73</a></p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>If only. I'm ashamed to say I got there too damned late and left with my wallet empty.</p> 

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>How's that possible?</p>

            CHREMES

            <p>A huge crowd showed up at Congress. The place was jam-packed with people I've never seen before. They looked like a bunch of white-collar types to us.<a href="#74" class="fn">74</a>It was a whitey-white Congress. So I got nothing. Neither did a bunch of the other guys.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>So if I went now I wouldn't get paid either?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Impossible. Not even if you got there before the cock crowed a second time.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros throws his hands up in frustration.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Alas! Wretched am I! (<em>quoting Aeschylus</em>)<a href="#75" class="fn">75</a>"Antilochus, pity me, and not these coins --for I still live. All is lost."</p>

            <p class="dir">He stops emoting.</p>

            <p>What could've been so important that all these people showed up this morning?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>(<em>sarcastically</em>) You mean aside from the President's desire to save the city?<a href="#76" class="fn">76</a></p>

            <p class="dir">Chremes grimaces as he remembers.</p>

            <p>And of course that fuzzy eye-hole Neocleides<a href="#77" class="fn">77</a> was the first one to slither up to the podium. The members of Congress shouted like you wouldn't believe: "How can this guy dare to advise us? <em>He's </em>the one telling <em>us </em>how to save the city, when he can't even save his own eyeball?"</p>


            <p>Then he shouted back, eyeing them up: "What the hell should I do?"</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>one beat behind</em>) That's easy. You just mix up some garlic with fig juice, stir in a little Spartan spurge, and rub it on your eyelids right before bed.<a href="#78" class="fn">78</a>(<em>pleased with himself</em>) 
            That's what I woulda said if I'd been there!</p>

            <p class="dir">Chremes rolls his eyes and ignores Blepyros.</p> 

            CHREMES 
            <p>(<em>warming to his theme</em>) And after him, Euaion,<a href="#79" class="fn">79</a> who's at least competent, came forward.
            – the poor bastard claimed he was wearing a coat but it was so tattered the crowd thought he was naked. He then spoke words that would appeal to any Democrat:<a href="#80" class="fn">80</a> (<em>putting on a whiny voice in imitation of Euaion</em>) "On the subject of safety, I'm sure you can see I myself need some bailing out – to the tune of four grand.<a href="#81" class="fn">81</a>But nevertheless, I'm going to tell you how you can save the city and its people. When winter comes round, retailers should give coats to the needy.<a href="#82" class="fn">82</a>That way, none of us would catch pneumonia. When a bed and bath are beyond their means, people should be allowed to sleep at the merchants' stores.<a href="#83" class="fn">83</a>And if the merchant locks them out in wintertime, he should be fined three blankets!"</p>
             
            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>speaking with wonder</em>) Zeus in the sky, that's brilliant! If only he'd added unlimited food for the poor no one would ever vote against it.<a href="#84" class="fn">84</a> And if any store manager tried to wiggle out of it, they'd end up squealing like a stuck pig. Even that stinge Nausicydes<a href="#85" class="fn">85</a> would have to comply.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>After that, an attractive young man, a bit pale (like Nikias<a href="#86" class="fn">86</a>) jumped up to address the crowd. He started to say that we should hand the city over to the women. There was an immediate uproar, and the crowd of cobblers shouted their approval. But the farmers were rumbling and grumbling against it.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Well, they had a point, by God.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Too bad there weren't more farmers. The speaker outshouted them, claiming that women do a lot of good.</p>

            <p class="dir">Chremes pauses, remembering something.</p>

            <p>But, you know, he also said <em>you</em> were good for nothing.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>caught off gaurd</em>) He said <em>what</em>?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>(<em>thinking back</em>) Well, first he said you're a fuckup.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Me? What about you?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>No, he didn't say anything about me. (<em>thinking again</em>) And also, that you're a thief.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Just me?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>That's right. And that you're an ambulance-chaser.<a href="#87" class="fn">87</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Just me?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Yes. And the rest of us too.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>shrugging in agreement</em>) Well, who could deny that? </p>


            CHREMES 
            <p>And he said that women are a sensible and resourceful sort. And then he said that they never spill the secrets of their religious festivals<a href="#88" class="fn">88</a> but that you and I always leak government information.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>nodding</em>) And by Hermes, he wasn't lying about that.</p>

            <p class="dir">The two laugh, remembering various secrets they've spilled.</p>

            CHREMES

            <p>And then he said that only women can lend each other nice coats, gold necklaces, money, and crystal goblets. AND they always give everything back! Without witnesses, without stealing....But, he kept saying, most of <em>us </em>do steal.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Yeah, even when there <em>are </em>witnesses!</p>

            CHREMES

            <p>Women don't trump up charges. They don't prosecute. They don't destroy our democracy. In fact, he said, they offer great benefits. And he continued to praise women to the skies. </p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>What was decided?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>To hand the city over to women. Everyone agreed this was the one thing our city hadn't tried yet. </p>

            <p class="dir">For a moment, Blepyros is mute with amazement.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>dumbstruck</em>) So it happened.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Yes, sir.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>catching on</em>) So now women are in charge of everything that men, the only <em>real </em>citizens, used to do?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>That's right.</p>

            BLEPYROS. 
            <p>(<em>still working it through</em>) Wait. So, I don't have to go to court. My wife does?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>And you don't have to support the kids you fathered anymore. Your wife does.</p>
             
            <p class="dir">Blepyros starts to see the bright side of things.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>And I don't have to drag my ass out of bed, groaning, at dawn anymore?</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>No sir. This is now the women's problem. You, my friend, can keep your ass at home, in bed. No groaning, just farting the day away.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>starting to panic</em>) But wait. We’re old. I'm afraid that, now that the women have grabbed the reins, they'll force us to… </p> 

            CHREMES 
            <p>(<em>also panicking</em>) To do what?!? </p> 

            <p class="dir">Blepyros pauses dramatically.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>To...fuck them!</p>


            CHREMES 
            <p>(<em>panicking more</em>) What if we can't?</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>(<em>nearly hysterical</em>) Yeah, they won't give us breakfast!</p>

            <p class="dir">The two start pacing frantically, trying to figure out what to do. Chremes mimes fellatio.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Just do this. That way you can eat and fuck at the same time!</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>despairingly</em>) Oh, it's just the worst when you're not in the mood!</p> 

            <p class="dir">They stop pacing and droop with resignation. Chremes takes a deep breath for courage.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>Well, if it will help the city, every man should comply.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>(<em>still distressed</em>, <em>but trying</em>) It's like that old saying: no matter how moronic and dumb our government, it will all turn out just fine for us.</p>

            <p class="dir">Chremes shakes his head.</p>

            CHREMES 
            <p>I sure as hell hope it will. But I've gotta go. You take care.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>to chorus</em>) OK, ladies, it looks like we've accomplished our objectives here. So rip off your coats before some man sees us. Your shoes have to come off. You there, untie those dress shoes. Everyone, drop your sticks.</p>

            <p class="dir">The women scramble to remove their men's attire. Praxagora turns to Woman One.</p>

            <p>I'm hoping to sneak inside without my husband seeing me. I've got to put his coat back and the other things I stole.</p>

            CHORUS
            <p>We've done everything you said. What else can we do to assist you? It's your job to show us, you're the smartest woman we know! </p> 

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Stick around --I'll need you as my advisors for this new government. Back there in the fray, you really manned up against the enemy.</p>

            <p class="dir">The stage turns dark, but a light gradually reveals Blepyros standing on one side of the stage. He is still wearing the nightie and mules. Two chairs stand next to him, indicating the house.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>A good friend of mine was in labor and wanted me there.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Couldn't you have told me before you left?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>And neglected my friend in pain?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Well, you still could have told me. Something's not right here.</p>

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>(<em>with exaggerated exasperation</em>) Goddesses almighty,<a href="#89" class="fn">89</a> I just went as I was. She needed me to get there as soon as possible.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>So you couldn't have taken your own coat? Instead you left me here like a goddamned corpse, stripped and wrapped in a shroud! Only you forgot the flowers and formaldehyde.<a href="#90" class="fn">90</a></p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>(<em>meekly</em>) But I was cold. And I'm so small and delicate. (<em>She shivers dramatically</em>.) I only did it to keep warm. And sweetie, I did leave you warm and snug in the covers.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Oh, so my shoes and cane just walked off with you?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>I was...(<em>improvising</em>) trying to imitate you, stomping your feet and beating the ground with your stick...so I wouldn't get mugged.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>Do you know that you've lost us our groceries<a href="#91" class="fn">91</a> for the week? I couldn't make it to Congress...</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Don't worry. A baby boy was born.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros is only half paying attention.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>In Congress?<a href="#92" class="fn">92</a></p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>No, you idiot. At my friend's house. (<em>baiting him by playing dumb</em>) But Congress met?</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros looks at Praxagora like she's the biggest idiot in the world.</p> 

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>God, yes. Don't you remember? I told you yesterday.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>It's coming back to me…</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>incredulous</em>) So you don't know the big news?</p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>(<em>with wide-eyed innocence</em>) Gosh, no I don't.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>You'd better sit and straighten your panties for this one.<a href="#93" class="fn">93</a></p>

            <p class="dir">He pulls up a chair and sits Praxagora down in it.</p>

            <p>The news is that the city is being handed over to you women.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>(<em>playing it as dumb as possible</em>) To do what? Clean?<a href="#94" class="fn">94</a></p> 

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>No, no, no. Rule.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Rule what?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Every single aspect of the city.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Great Girdle of Aphrodite! 

            </p><p class="dir">She leaps from her chair enthusiastically.</p> 

            <p>Then the city's in good shape from here on out!</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Why's that?</p> 

            <p class="dir">As Praxagora begins to speak, The Neighbor wanders in.<a href="#95" class="fn">95</a> He stands unnoticed, listening quietly to Praxagora speaking.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>For a lot of reasons. From now on, no one will dare do anything immoral. There will be no more perjury, no more ambulance chasing…<a href="#96" class="fn">96</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>By God, you can't do that! You'd put me out of a job!</p>

            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>For Zeussakes, man, let the woman speak!</p> 

            <p class="dir">Both Blepyros and Praxagora jump, but Praxagora quickly recovers. The Neighbor pulls up a chair and sits down.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>…no more muggings, no more keeping up with the Joneses,<a href="#97" class="fn">97</a> no more homelessness or poverty,<a href="#98" class="fn">98</a> no more slander, and no more foreclosures.<a href="#99" class="fn">99</a></p>


            NEIGHBOR 
            <p>Trident of Poseidon, that sounds awesome! If you're not making it up.</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>No, I'll prove it, as long as you'll be my witness and this guy (<em>points to Blepyros</em>) won't interrupt. </p>

            <p class="dir">Music begins to play.</p>

            CHORUS 

            <p>Rouse that clever heart,<br> 
            that rugged mind of yours,<br>  
            Defend your men, your valiant kin-the women in the fray.<br>  
            </p>

            <p>Your voice cries out for new vision,<br>  
            Success in life,<br>  
            Endless benefits,<br>  
            Honor for the city, power to the people!<br>  
            The moment is here, the time is now.<br>  
            </p>

            <p>The city needs our innovation,<br>  
            something shrewd never done,<br>  
            never even <em>mentioned</em>! 
            </p>

            <p>Do it now!</p>

            <p>The crowd hates to see the same ol' thing,<br>  
            Snap to it, and do what needs doing,<br>  
            They like it best when we keep it moving.
            </p> 


            <p class="dir">The music stops. The chorus marches offstage and the Neighbor follows. Praxagora steps forward.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>I'm absolutely certain that my plans will be effective. But the audience…(<em>pointing at them all</em>) I'm not sure if they're ready for real change, or if they're too stuck on tradition. That's my biggest concern. </p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>Don't worry about instituting crazy new policies. That's the whole point of democracy — to neglect our traditions!</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>(<em>with oratorical gravitas</em>) Now, please do not interrupt me or oppose my plans before you understand my intentions and hear my full proposal. </p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros sits down and listens attentively as Praxagora outlines her vision.</p>

            <p>My vision is for all people to unite their resources and share equally in everything. All citizens will thrive on the common stores. No longer will one man be rich while another remains poor. No longer will one man own acres of land, while another can't even afford a plot for burial. No longer will one man benefit off the backs of many slaves, while another has no one to help him. </p>


            <p>Instead, I offer a single, common livelihood for all.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>interrupting</em>) How will it be common for all?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>(<em>dropping the somber tone</em>) Cut the crap, I'm almost there.<a href="#100" class="fn">100</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>(<em>with earnest innocence</em>) Do we have to the cut the crap equally, too?</p>

            PRAXAGORA  

            <p>Zeus on a cloud, you keep interrupting me! I was just about to tell you.</p>

            <p class="dir">She sighs and gets back into character.</p> 

            <p>First and foremost property will be shared by everyone. Money too, and all other valuables anyone might have. Then, we will draw from the common fund to feed you. Since we are thrifty and competent, we will act as treasurers.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros still isn't following.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>But what about the guy who doesn't own any property? Just silver and gold – you know, hidden assets?<a href="#101" class="fn">101</a></p> 

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>He'll put it in the pot. And if he doesn't, he'll be lying under oath.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>That's how he acquired it!</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>His money will be worthless anyway.</p> 

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>How's that?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>(<em>patiently</em>) Everyone will have everything they need, so no one will be forced to steal because he's poor: there will be bread, fish, rice cakes, clothing, wine, wreaths, and chickpeas.<a href="#102" class="fn">102</a> What could anyone gain by not contributing? You figure it out and get back to me.</p>

            BLEPYROS
            <p>Aren't rich people pretty much thieves, anyway?</p>

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>Yes, my friend, they were under the old regime. But now, when there's a common livelihood, what could anyone gain by not contributing?</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros sees a potential problem.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>All right, well, what if a guy sees a young girl he's interested in and wants to poke her? He'd need his own money to buy her gifts. (<em>more optimistically</em>) But, I suppose, if he did get to sleep with her, he would get a piece, so to speak, ha! ha!</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>Well, actually, he'll get to sleep with her for free. I'll make sure that girls are available for sex – and for procreation, if anyone wants.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>But wouldn't every guy go straight for the hottest girl and try to hump her? </p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>The really ugly and pig-nosed girls will sit next to the pretty ones. When a guy is hot for a pretty one, he'll have to bang the ugly one first. </p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>What about old guys like me? If I sleep with an ugly one, my boner won't be able to limp its way over to a hottie. </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Cheer up, sweetie. They won't be giving <em>you </em>a fight. Don't you worry.</p>
             
            BLEPYROS

            <p>A fight? About what?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>About <em>not</em> sleeping with you. You've already got that problem.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>sarcastically</em>) Your plan makes perfect sense. This legislation ensures that no woman's funhole will go unfilled. But where will the <em>men </em>find fulfillment? Chicks will run screaming from the beasts, and straight for the babes. </p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>The really ugly guys will shadow the hot ones after parties and tail them at state fairs. Women will be prohibited from sleeping with large, sexy men before pleasuring the small, ugly ones.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>So goiter-nosed Lysicrates<a href="#103" class="fn">103</a>will seem just as sexy as the hot guys?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>Yep! That's the populist thrust! We'll brutally mock the rich and famous, even the ones sporting pinkie rings!<a href="#104" class="fn">104</a> Just imagine: a poor guy in sandals<a href="#105" class="fn">105</a> walks right up to a well-heeled young fellow and says, "Step aside and watch this! When I'm done, I'll hand her over to you for sloppy seconds."</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>But if we're all hooking up like that, how will a father recognize his own son?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>What does it matter? Young people will think of all older men as their own fathers.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>But then wouldn't they choke every old man, good and proper? They do that now, when they <em>do</em> know who their father is. Worse yet, if they don't recognize their dad, won't they shit all over him?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>No. Bystanders won't just stand by anymore. Before, they didn't care if someone was beating up another guy's dad. But now, if they hear someone getting beaten up, they'll worry it's their own dad and go after the criminals.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>Hmmm. What you're saying here isn't too dumb. But what if Epicurus or Lukolophos<a href="#106" class="fn">106</a> comes over and calls me "Daddy"? (<em>shuddering</em>) Now <em>that </em>would be nasty.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>There's something far nastier than that…</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>What?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>If Aristyllus,<a href="#107" class="fn">107</a> that butt-licker, calls you "Daddy" --and gives you a little kiss.</p>


            BLEPYROS 

            <p>Then I'd make him cry and moan like a little girl.</p>

            <p>PRAXAGORA Yeah, but you'd still smell like a poop-ermint…<a href="#108" class="fn">108</a></p>

            <p class="dir">She chuckles at her own joke.</p> 

            <p>Don't worry, he's not gonna kiss you. Lucky for you, he was born before our legislation passed.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>(<em>relieved</em>) Phew! That would have been horrible. (<em>changing subject</em>) But who's going to farm the land?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>The slaves. Your only concern will be getting cleaned up for dinner as soon as night falls.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>What about clothing? Where will it come from? Now <em>that</em> is a worthy question.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>You'll be fine with what you have for now. In the future, the women will make more.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>One last question. If someone loses a case in court, how will he have any money to pay the fine? 
            It would be wrong to pay it from the common fund.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>First of all, there won't be any court cases.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>That's the worst thing you could say.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>I get your point. But why on earth would there be lawsuits?</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>For a lot of reasons, by Apollo's quiver. In the first place, if a debtor defaults on his loan.</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>Where would a lender get money if everything is jointly owned? Clearly, he'd be a thief.</p>

            BLEPYROS 

            <p>By the piglets of Demeter, that makes good sense. But tell me this, if someone is convicted of battery, how will he pay the fine – especially when he's drunk and disorderly? I'm pretty sure I've got you there!</p>

            PRAXAGORA 

            <p>He'll pay it from his own ration of food. Trust me, once his food's gone, he'll feel it right in the stomach and he won't be so quick to violate this law again.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>So there'll be no more thieves from here on out?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>How can someone steal from himself?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>So there won't be any more nighttime robberies?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>(<em>pointedly</em>) Not if <em>you</em> stay home at night.</p>

            <p>(<em>returning to her explanation</em>) Seriously though, it won't happen, since everyone will have what they need. And if someone gets mugged, he'll just hand over his stuff. Why would he bother fighting? He can just go get something newer and better from the communal stores.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>Won't men still gamble, though?</p>

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>No, why would they?</p>

            BLEPYROS
            <p>Well, then, what standard of living are you offering?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>The same one for everyone. I intend to make the city into one big household, breaking down all doors and allowing unrestricted access.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>(<em>concerned</em>) But where will we eat?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>I'll turn every courtroom and pavilion into a dining hall.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>What good will the judge's bench do us?<a href="#109" class="fn">109</a></p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>I'll turn it into a wine bar.<a href="#110" class="fn">110</a> And it can be a place for small children to recite poems about brave men in war, but also poems about cowards, if there are any, so they'll be too ashamed to join the feast.</p>

            BLEPYROS

            <p>That's lovely, by the curly locks of Apollo! What will you do with the machines that assign jury duty?<a href="#111" class="fn">111</a></p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p>I'll set them up in the public square, next to the Harmodius statue,<a href="#112" class="fn">112</a> and I'll use them to assign everyone a letter at random. That way, everyone will know what group they're in and saunter off happily to dinner. When the announcement is made, the Betas will go to the royal pavilion,<a href="#113" class="fn">113</a> the Thetas to the one next to it,<a href="#114" class="fn">114</a> and the Kappas will go to the warehouse pavilion.<a href="#115" class="fn">115</a></p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>So they can drink to <em>Kapp</em>-acity? Ha ha!!</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>No, you idiot, just to eat.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>But you'll turn away anyone without a group assignment, won't you?</p>

            PRAXAGORA 
            <p>That won't happen under our plan. We'll eradicate envy by providing everyone with everything. Each and every man will happily stumble home drunk by torchlight, with flowers in his hair. Women will line the streets, falling all over these carousers, saying, "Come to our place. A pretty young thing awaits you." Another woman will shout down from her balcony: "I've got one at my place for you. She's gorgeous with perfect skin. You can have her, but you've got to sleep with me first." Meanwhile those ugly guys tailing the hot, young ones will say, "You there. Where do you think you're going? You won't be doing anything at all, even if you are faster than me. We disgusting caveman types<a href="#116" class="fn">116</a> get to fuck first! It's the law. In the meantime, you pretty boys will just have to stand in the hall and jiggle your fig tree."<a href="#117" class="fn">117</a></p>


            <p class="dir">She crosses her arms triumphantly.</p>

            <p>So tell me, how do you like that?</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>A lot!</p>

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>I've got to go to the town square to collect all the property coming in. I'll take along a spokeswoman with a strong voice. As your elected leader, it's now my responsibility to get the dining rooms set up so that today can be our first feast.</p>

            <p class="dir">Blepyros licks his lips with anticipation.</p>

            BLEPYROS
            <p>Wow, we'll be feasting that soon?</p>

            PRAXAGORA
            <p>Damn straight. But right now I've got to put a stop to every last one of those whores turning tricks.</p>

            BLEPYROS 
            <p>Why would you want to do <em>that</em>?</p>

            PRAXAGORA

            <p class="dir">She starts dragging him offstage. A third hag appears and addresses Epigenes.</p>

            THIRD HAG 
            <p>Where the hell do you think you're going with her?</p>

            <p class="dir">Epigenes, busy fighting off the second hag, responds without noticing the Third Hag.</p>

            EPIGENES
            <p>I'm not <em>going</em>. I'm <em>being dragged</em>. But God bless you, whoever you are, for not not allowing her to grind me to a pulp.</p>

            <p class="dir">The action freezes. Epigenes steps forward and addresses the audience in the faux-tragic manner of a hero about to die.</p>

            <p>Thrice-wretched am I! For now I must fuck a woman, rotting and old, all night and all day.

For my heart is burdened and I am an unlucky man, by Zeus the Savior, I who am caged in with beastly fiends like these. And yet if I, an intrepid sailor, must suffer the insufferable at the hands of these nasty slags, then bury me at the mouth of the river. And at the head of my grave, take this old lady, wrap her in a shroud, encase her feet in cement, and set her up as my tombstone.</p>

And all of you standing in front of our doors, you neighbors and townspeople, I am your serving maid. I am scented from head to toe with lovely fragrance, by Zeus the Seducer. These bottles of the imported stuff are the best.<a href="#173" class="fn">173</a> The best by far. They go right to your head and the effects linger.....All the others fade and fly away.

            <p class="dir">The chorus begins to file quietly onto the stage. The Chorus Leader grabs the first two chorus members, pulls them aside, and steers them towards Blepyros. They swan towards him and put their arms around his shoulders, giggling.</p>

            <p>(<em>to Blepyros</em>) There's some of the expensive wine left over, and some other tasty treats.</p> 

            <p class="dir">She turns to the chorus as it files in, clapping her hands smartly.</p>


            <p>Don't delay!</p>

            <p class="dir">The chorus is now on stage, waiting silently in the background. The Chorus Leader turns her attention towards the audience.</p>

            <p>But first I'd like to give a little advice to the critics.</p>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
              <div class="note" id="1"><p>1. In the Greek, the lines that follow employ tragic diction and meter (Sommerstein 1), but 
              are meant to parody tragic apostrophe by addressing mundane subject matter (Ussher 70). 
              We have used quasi-Shakespearean diction to capture the somber form of the speech.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="2"><p>2. Ancient Greek women used lamp flames to remove hair from what we would now call 
              the bikini line.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="3"><p>3. The Scira festival was held every June in honor of the goddess Demeter. Because only 
              women were allowed to attend, it would have been a perfect place to begin a female 
              conspiracy. In <em>Thesmophoriazousai </em>(another Aristophanes play) the women conspire at a 
              different festival to Demeter called the Thesmophoria.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="4"><p>4. Fur-OH-mack-us. Nothing else is known about Phyromachus. Sommerstein (4) suggests 
              that the following joke puns off of the dual meaning of "seat" as both "place to sit" and 
              "rump".</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="5"><p>5. Literally, "a man from Salamis". Salamis is an island off the coast of Athens. Its 
              inhabitants were Athenian citizens and had a reputation for both nautical and sexual prowess.</p>
              </div>


              <div class="note" id="6"><p>6. Pronounced Kline-ah-REH-tay, So-STRAH-tay, Phil-ein-EH-tay. The Greek sound represented by  the letter "e" is more like the sound of a European "e" than the drawn-out American long "a" (which non-Americans hear as "ayyyyy"). </p>
              </div>    

              <div class="note" id="7"><p>7. In ancient Greece, wine was measured by the <em>khous </em>(about 3/4 gallon) and chickpeas by the <em>khoinix </em>(about a quart). We have given rough equivalents. Paying with wine is a punishment because women's love of it was legendary; chickpeas were often eaten as snacks to accompany drinking. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="8"><p>8. Mel-is-STIH-kay. In the Greek, Melistiche's husband is identified as Smikythion, who may or may not be the same as a certain impotent Smikythion named in <em>Wasps </em>401 (Sommerstein 7). The shoes are <em>embades</em>, normally reserved for men.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="9"><p>9. BOOZE-ih-strah-tah, Geusistrate in the original Greek. The name comes from the verb <em>geusesthai</em>, "to tipple". Her name and profession suggest that she is exceedingly fond of drink --even for a woman. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="10"><p>10. Phil-oh-door-REH-tus, Kai-reh-TAH-days. In ancient Greece, women are frequently identified only by their relationship to a male relative, both in Aristophanes and in law courts. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="11"><p>11. The original Greek designates anchovies, which caused the husband to cough all night. Anchovies were a popular snack food in ancient Greece, and the tiny "hair" bones they contained could make a person cough. As it is not normal practice to eat plain anchovies in the modern world, we have used a more plausible-sounding substitution.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="12"><p>12. Pale skin was the feminine ideal for women in ancient Greece, as was remaining indoors unless there was a good reason to be out of the house. Thus, a tanned appearance was considered masculine in that it was the result of outdoor labor. Since a tan is associated with leisure in today's society, however, we have used "farmer’s tan" to avoid the wrong connotations. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="13"><p>13. Hecate (pronounced Heh-CAH-tay) was the Greek goddess associated with magic.</p>
              </div> 

              <div class="note" id="14"><p>14. The original joke is "better than Epicrates’ beard'" Since Epicrates was a politician known for mainly for his beard, we have omitted the name and focused on the trait (cf. Ussher 84 and Sommerstein 9).</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="15"><p>15. Literally "Laconian shoes, walking sticks, and men's cloaks". "Laconian" (i.e. Spartan) shoes are a more formal version of men's <em>embades </em>(see note 8). Walking sticks were associated with men going to Congress. And men's cloaks (<em>himatia) </em>would have appeared distinctly masculine to Aristophanes' original audience.</p>
              </div> 

              <div class="note" id="16"><p>16. The implement referred to is the <em>skutalon</em>, a baton used by Spartans to carry coded messages. The message could only be read when wrapped around the baton of similar size. This particualar baton belongs to a certain Lamius, whose name will shortly become 
              the butt of several jokes.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="17"><p>17. The original meaning of this complex joke is controversial, and involves several 
              references peculiar to Athenian politics and culture. Most critics agree that Lamius is 
              being compared to Lamia, a monster who farted horrifically. In Greek, the man is 
              wearing "the leather jerkin of Argos" (<em>dipthera panoptou</em>). Argos was a mythical 
              guardian and servant of Hera, who watched Io with his hundred eyes. Some suggest the 
              leather garment itself (a <em>diphthera</em>) indicates peasant status, while some argue that the 
              jerkin would be full of holes to accommodate Argos' hundred eyes. Finally, the joke 
              employs the phrase <em>boukouleîn dêmion </em>meaning "to fulfill a duty" but also "to drive 
              cattle" – and so may further emphasize the rustic nature of the joke's target. Because it 
              would be impossible to find modern equivalencies to all elements, we have chosen to 
              retain the political joke in its most general sense. For a complete explanation of the joke, 
              see Sommerstein 10-11.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="18"><p>18. Literally, "seats under the stone [and] in front of the <em>prytaneis</em>." The "stone" refers to 
              the speakers' platform (<em>bêma </em>in Greek). The <em>prytaneis </em>(singular <em>prytanis</em>) were the 
              "chairmen" of the Athenian Assembly, and it was their job to oversee speakers.
              </p></div>

              <div class="note" id="19"><p>19. Originally, Woman Two plans to comb through unspun wool while sitting in Congress. 
              This is a typically feminine activity, and while sitting to perform her task, a woman might 
              strike an "indecorous" pose with her knees apart (Ussher 88).</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="20"><p>20. Fro-ME-see-us. As the scholiast on <em>Frogs</em> 965 tells us, Phromisius was a man known 
              for his excessive hairiness. Aristophanes here uses the name as a euphemism for female

              <div class="note" id="21"><p>21. Ar-GEAR-ree-us, Pro-NO-mus. Agyhrrius was a prominent politician in the early 
              fourth century, and the frequent butt of jokes. We have no further information about 
              Pronomos. The spoken line could also suggest "Pronomos <em>as </em>beard," playing on the 
              modern sense of the word "beard".</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="22"><p>22. Literally: "They say that the young men who get pounded the most are the most clever 
              speakers." Homosexual relationships between older and younger men were a standard 
              part of the social and political "boys' club" of Classical Athens; "speakers" refers to the 
              fact that the younger men would eventually go on to become political leaders who spoke 
              in the Assembly.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="23"><p>23. The joke indicates the contrast between the woman's tanned (but still light) skin and the 
              dark beard.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="24"><p>24. The actual practice of the Athenian Assembly was to sacrifice a piglet, then have an 
              officiant circle the area to designated it as purified. The women (who have not actually 
              attended Congress before) show their ignorance by using a weasel instead of a piglet.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="25"><p>25. In the original Greek this remark is addressed to a certain Ariphrades, who may or 
              may not be a politician known for his loquaciousness.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="26"><p>26. Laurel wreaths were worn both for speaking in public and for celebrating in private.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="note" id="29"><p>29. Said something like "Jeez." Given the frequency with which "By Zeus" (<em>ne Dia</em>) 
              appears in speech, it seems unlikely to have the solemn tone it suggests to moderns.</p>
              </div> 


              <div class="note" id="30"><p>30. The oath refers to the "twin goddesses," i.e. Persephone and Demeter and was only 
              used by women, which is why Praxagora reacts the way she does.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="31"><p>31. Eh-PIG-on-us. Significance unknown, though obviously he was considered effeminate 
              in some capacity.</p>
              </div> 

              <div class="note" id="32"><p>32. Since we do not see Praxagora at work in Congress, we must read what follows as the 
              text of the speech she eventually gives. Thus, it is slightly less comedic than the previous 
              portion of the scene.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="33"><p>33. The time "before Congress existed" is an exaggeration, and most likely refers to the 
              time before pay for service was insituted. Argyrrius is the same character mentioned 
              above (see note 21), and had been convicted of embezzlement.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="34"><p>34. Literally, "the one taking pay" versus "the one not taking pay." But the participle 
              implies a person that doesn't want to <em>be seen </em>taking pay, rather than someone who is truly 
              devoted to the people's interests.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="35"><p>35. The alliance referred to is most likely the Athenian-Theban alliance of 395, or a 
              slightly later alliance that included Argos and Corinth as well. Both were formed against 
              the Spartans, and Aristophanes/Praxagora may well be conflating them.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="36"><p>36. Later scholiasts identify this man as Conon, but Sommerstein feels this is an error (21) 
              and offers Epicrates as a possible substitute.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="37"><p>37. Although Athens was a democracy, enormous disparities in wealth existed. The 
              "desperate" are those who must work for a living (which is not ideal in Athenian political 
              thought) and who would appreciate the opportunity to work for pay in shipyards or as 
              sailors. Citizens with money, on the other hand, were expected to foot the bill for the cost 
              of building and outfitting ships. Farmers, whose land lay outside the city walls of Athens, 
              were most likely to suffer the effects of war as it was accepted practice to destroy the 
              enemy's fields as part of a campaign.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="38"><p>38. After the Battle of Nemea in 394, an anti-Corinthian faction refused to let the retreating 
              allies enter Corinth, leading some to fear that Corinth might switch its loyalties to the 
              Spartan side. In 393/2, however, a strong anti-Spartan faction took over, and Corinth 
              merged with Argos.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="39"><p>39. It is not entirely clear what these statements mean, other than that they are opposite sides of the debate. But after merging with Corinth, Argos was displeased with the peace terms of the treaty with Sparta. We know little about Hieronymus (Hear-ON-i-muss), except that he was an Athenian general at the time. From what Praxagora says, we may presume that he, too, was oppsed to the peace terms.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="40"><p>40. Thrasybulus was Athenian general who began a successful career in the later Peloponnesian War. He was received with general favor by the Athenians and is well-attested in our sources. Here, Praxagora implies that he was opposed to peace for his own selfish reasons, rather than for sound political ones.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="41"><p>41. Aesimus was allied with Thrasybulus, but we know little about him, leading most scholars to assume that his career went downhill after the 390's. He is, however, mentioned as still being active in 378/7.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="42"><p>42. In Greek, the Thesmophoria, a yearly festival in honor of Demeter. Only women were allowed, and they were thus were responsible for performing the rites correctly.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="43"><p>43. Literally, Praxagora was camped out "on the Pnyx". As mentioned in note 37 above, farmers had little protection against enemy troops and so were brought inside the city walls during wartime. The most famous refugee influx came at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war in 431. Given that other characters mention Praxagora's youthful appearance, however, it is unlikely that she refers to this time period. Other war-driven flights happened in 413 and 405, so it is likely she refers to one of these.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="44"><p>44. The women literally offer her the position of <em>strategos</em>, "general", but the duties imparted by this title go beyond military power. </p>

              </div>

              <div class="note" id="47"><p>47. <em>melankholân</em>, "to be melancholy", literally means one's bile has turned black. 
              According the the dictates of ancient medicine, this was an indication of extreme mental 
              disturbance.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="48"><p>48. <em>tryblia</em>, shallow bowls used for soup.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="50"><p>50. A children's song, according to the scholiast, meant to taunt those with poor eyesight.</p>

              <div class="note" id="51"><p>51. The original Greek refers to a breakfast goulash involving pickled garlic, and may

              </div>

              <div class="note" id="52"><p>52. Literally "looking <em>hupotrimma</em>." <em>hupotrimma </em>was a kind of sauce. Though we do not 
              know its contents, we presume that it is spicy because in other such phrases ("looking 
              like" such-and-such a condiment), Aristophanes uses piquant food such as watercress or mustard.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="53"><p>53. Literally, "The <em>thesmothetês </em> threatens that he won't get his three obols." The <em>thesmothetês </em>was an officer whose job it was to pay the jurors. Though ancient Greek coingage is a complex topic, for this play it should suffice to know that obols were the a type of coin worth one-sixth of a <em>drachma</em>. </p>

              <div class="note" id="54"><p>54. Charitimides may indicate a famous general active in the 450's. The other two names do not appear to have any special significance apart from being masculine.</p>

             <div class="note" id="61"><p>61. Kinesias was a poet known both for his impiety and for his diarrhea. Sommerstein suggests that <em>Frogs </em>366 and this joke both refer to an incident when Kinesias defecated on a statue of Hecate. </p>

              <div class="note" id="62"><p>62. Literally, "little saffron-colored [dress]". Saffron was used to dye clothing, and the color itself was generally deemed feminine. </p>

              <div class="note" id="64"><p>64. Literally "a wild pear (<em>akhras</em>) is plugging up the grain supply". Wild pears were thought to cause constipation. The reference to the grain supply sets up the following political joke. </p>

              <div class="note" id="65"><p>65. The original Greek reads: "Not the one that Thrasybulus told the Spartans about." The sense is unclear, especially given the mood of the verb, but Sommerstein (40) suggests that Thrasybulus "delivered a violent invective against the Spartans".</p>

              matters little which one is referred to. The "groans", which are most likely a reference to 
              groaining in pain, lead Sommerstein (41) to suggest that this Antisthenes was elderly and 
              suffering from some illness. Blepyros, however, takes the groans as indicative of sexual 
              activity.</p>

              </div>

              <div class="note" id="73"><p>73. Three obols, originally. It is always difficult to translate currency units from ancient to 
              modern, but rather than trying to find precise figures we have chosen a term that is likely 
              to remain recognizable for a long period of time.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="74"><p>74. Literally, "they looked like shoemakers." Shoemakers worked indoors, and were thus 
              thought of us being particularly pale for men. This is Chremes' explanation for

              property of the debtor, but we have chosen a more understandable example from the 
              modern world.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="100"><p>100. Literally, "even it were about eating shit, you'd want to go before me." Praxagora 
              means to highlight Blepyros' interruption, but he takes it literally.</p> 
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="101"><p>101. The gold mentioned in the Greek text is specifically gold Darics, Persian coins 
              circulated by Athenians during a shortage of their own coinage. Money was generally 
              considered an "invisible" asset in comparison to property and land.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="102"><p>102. These items are what one could expect at a moderate banquet.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="103"><p>103. Lie-SICK-crah-tees, of whom we know little else aside from another reference in this 
              play (see note 123). Obviously, he is considered unattractive because of his prominent 
              nose: the original Greek reads "The nose of Lysicrates will now seem on par with 
              handsome men?"</p>
              </div>

              <div class="note" id="104"><p>104. Literally "those having seals," i.e. signet rings bearing the family seal – an 
              ostentatious show of wealth that Praxagora hopes to stop.</p> 
              </div>


              <div class="note" id="105"><p>105. Literally, the same kind of shoes (<em>embades</em>) the women steal at the beginning of the 
              play. Here they seem to indicate the sort of footwear a common man (rather than rich 
              young buck) would wear.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="106"><p>106. Nothing certain is known about these figures.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="107"><p>107. Aristyllus is mentioned in two other Aristophanes passages, both of which repeat the 
              accusation that Aristyllus either eats dung or enjoys licking anuses.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="108"><p>108. A pun in Greek as well. Literally, "you would smell of peppermint", <em>kalaminthê; </em>the 
              word for "poop" was <em>minthos</em>.</p></div>


              <div class="note" id="109"><p>109. Blepyros refers to the <em>bêma</em>, the speaker's podium in a court.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="110"><p>110. Literally, "I will put wine jugs and water vessels on it." Ancient wine was much stronger than modern, and had to be mixed with water.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="111"><p>111. A <em>klêrôtêrion </em>allowed people to draw lots for jury duty in public, giving maximum transparency to the process of random assignment. Praxagora will use the same system to assign dining groups.</p></div>


              <div class="note" id="112"><p>112. Harmodius and his friend Aristogeiton killed the brother of the tyrant Hipparchus, and as such were national heroes. Bronze statues of them stood in the Agora.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="113"><p>113. The <em>stoa basileos </em>is literally "the colonnade of the king," but in Athenian practice contained the office of one of the nine archons.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="114"><p>114. Sommerstein (73) identifies this as the <em>stoa </em>of Zeus Eleutherios to the south of the <em>stoa basileos</em>.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="115"><p>115. The <em>Stoa Alphitopôlis </em>is literally the "Colonnade of the Corn Market," the location of which is not known with certainty.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="116"><p>116. Literally, "hideous and apelike".</p></div> 
              <div class="note" id="117"><p>117. The appearance of figs still on the tree was thought to resemble male genitalia.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="118"><p>118. A pun on <em>akmas</em>, literally the "tip" or "top". Thus, it could refer to the "cream of the crop" or to the tip of a penis.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="119"><p>119. Greek used "piglet" (<em>khoiros</em>) exactly as English uses "pussy," as slang for female genitalia. Respectable upper-class women trimmed, plucked, and singed to keep their pubic hair groomed.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="120"><p>120. Literally, "that [guy] of the General" — referencing Praxagora's standing as <em>strategos</em> (note 44) and inverting the normal practice of referring to women by means of their realtionship to male relatives (cf. note 10).</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="121"><p>121. The "parade" Chremes describes is actually a ritual procession. The roles he will designate for his items make it likely he is thinking of the Panatheniac festival, in particular.<br>
              The flour-sifter is a device meant to separate bran from flour, and Chremes designates it 
              "basket-bearer" (<em>kanêphoros</em>). The basket-bearers were teenaged girls who carried 
              baskets containing ritual implements for the sacrifice, and they led the procession. The 
              sifter's floury appearance suggests a woman because women too were often "powdered" 
              with white lead, used to make their skin appear paler.</p>
              </div>  


              <div class="note" id="122"><p>122. "But who will be the stool carrier?" The <em>diphrophoros </em>carried a stool for the baketbearers to sit on.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="123"><p>123. The same big-nosed Lysicrates mentioned earlier (see note 103). Chremes implies that the pot is as black as the one Lysicrates uses to mix his dye.</p></div> 


              <div class="note" id="124"><p>124. A <em>kommôtria </em>was a maid responsible for helping her mistress with her toillette. In a ritual context, the <em>kommôtria </em>carried s parasol to shield the baske-bearer from the sun.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="125"><p>125. "Bring the jug, water-carrier!" The <em>hydriaphoroi </em>("water carriers") were the daughters of resident aliens, and they carried jugs of water (<em>hydria</em>) in the procession. Since the Greek puns on both the word-formation and function, and we have tried to preserve both aspects.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="126"><p>126. "Cithara-carriers "(<em>kitharôidoi</em>) were musicians in the procession.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="127"><p>127. Resident aliens carried trays with offerings of honeycombs as part of the ritual.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="128"><p>128. In the Panathenaic procession, old men would carry olive branches.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="129"><p>129. "And the two tripods and the oil flask (<em>lekythos</em>)". Tripods were three-legged cooking pots that could stand over a fire. Sommerstein suggests the oli flask stands in for the large <em>amphorae </em>of oil used in the real procession.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="130"><p>130. "the rest" translates <em>okhlos</em>, which refers to the general populace watching the procession.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="131"><p>131. The dissenter refers to the practice of selling off debtors' goods and property if they were in default. It is the same practice referred to in note 99.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="132"><p>132. Literally, "making a parade for Hieron the judge." Sommerstein suggests that the dissenter is "trying to make sense of what he sees by associating it with something that commonly happens (or happened, before the revolution) in ordinary life, and we should probably deduce that when goods were displayed for sale by public auction…they were often put out in a long row on a table or board." (79). Nothing is known about Hieron, so we have ommitted his name in the translation.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="133"> <p>133. The motion of putting out the hand with palm up is associated with magistrates asking for a bribe.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="134"><p>134. All of these would be considered bad omens --at least to those of a superstitious bent.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="135"><p>135. The same groaning Antisthenes mentioned in note 70 --as the following joke makes clear --and the joke also implies that losing money would make him groan even more.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="136"><p>136. Callimachus is a "chorus-trainer" (<em>khorodidaskolos) </em>and possibly a composer of poetry as well.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="137"><p>137. Callias was a man of property, which makes it more egregious that he will not contribute --although see the following joke. Despite his adultery and debauchery, Callias was active in political and religious matters, and was elected <em>strategos </em>in 391.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="138"><p>138. We do not know which decree this refers to but salt was an expensive commodity in the ancient worl and the scholiast suggests that this decree would have aimed to reduce its price.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="139"><p>139. In 406, silver-plated bronze coins were struck as emergency coinage; they quickly fell in value, hence the Dissenter's disgust.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="140"><p>140. Technically, Chremes says he had a "mouthful" of bronze coins; it was standard Athenian practice to carry coins in the mouth.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="141"><p>141. Presumably because of their low value; it is also possible that Chremes is exaggerating.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="142"><p>142. Readings of the name vary between Euripides and Heurippides. Either way, the proposed tax rate of 2.5% is more than double the rate.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="143"><p>143. Literally, "dip him in gold," a metaphor for showering with praise, then "cover with pitch", as preparation for burning him alive. We have made the first metaphor more explicit, as it seemed likely that modern audiences would take the it as literally as the second phrase.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="144"><p>144. Literally, "the dining-couches are strewn with rugs and pillows." Ancient couches were not upholstered, and these accessories were meant to suggest luxury. Since modern couches <em>are </em>generally upholstered, we have translated accordingly.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="145"><p>145. In the Greek, these are <em>myropôolides</em>, female perfume-sellers. Presumably they are providing perfume at no cost, per the new regulations.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="146"><p>146. We know nothing of Smoios outside of other references in Aristophanes, all of which suggestion he enjoyed performing oral sex on women. (Note: this was not a compliment in ancient Greece.) "Bowl" is used euphemistically for female genetalia. Smoios is wearing a cavalry outfit, which would indicate youth, but we presume this is meant as an incongruous costume for an older man; it may also suggest "riding" in a sexual sense.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="147"><p>147. GEH-ron. Geron simply means "old man", and may or may not be an actual person; Sommerstein suggests this may also be a corruption of Hieron. Either way, his youthful clothing does not suit his age.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="148"><p>148. "barley cake" (<em>maza</em>) served as an all-purpose base for sauces and relishes.</p></div> 

             <div class="note" id="149"><p>149. Literally, "I've plastered myself with white lead." Ancient women used white lead much like modern women use foundation, and several jokes will play on the hag's heavy-handed makeup application.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="150"><p>150. We have omitted "one of the Ionian [songs]." Ionian songs were thought to be sensual and luxurious.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="151"><p>151. Literally an <em>auletês</em>, most often translated as "flute player." But thea ancient flute (<em>aulos</em>) is a reed instrument held vertically, more like a clarinet or oboe than our modern flute.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="152"><p>152. The original Greek uses the word <em>mêlon</em>, which means "apple" most literally, but is also used metaphorically for rosy cheeks and breasts. Rather than choosing only translation, we have tried to express the semantic range.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="153"><p>153. Literally, "invite Orthagoras". Though it is an attested name, the girl here plays on the sense of <em>orthos </em>("straight, hard") to suggest the old hag find a dildo.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="154"><p>154. Literally "you put the L [<em>lambda</em>] in Lesbian". In the ancient world "lesbian" did not carry the implication that it does today. Rather, women from the isle of Lesbos were known for their skill at fellatio.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="155"><p>155. The girl refers to both the white lead used as foundation and to the overapplication of blush.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="156"><p>156. Literally, Gerês, whom the scholiast identifies as a real person known for being old and bald. But the word also puns on "old age."</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="157"><p>157. Literally, " a man from the <em>deme </em>of Anaphlystos", punning on the verb <em>anaphlyôn</em>, "to get erect." We presume the young man refers to self-pleasure as a way to avoid being taken in by the hag.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="158"><p>158. Dick-STIFF-ah-knees, for Greek 'Sebinos', which is not a real name but a word derived from <em>se binein </em>--"a guy to fuck you".</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="159"><p>159. The language used in this joke plays on a genuine political issue. At certain points there was not enough money to run the court system, resulting in moratoriums on cases worth less than a certain fiscal value. The young man uses legal language, originally intended to refer to sums of money, to pun on age in years.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="160"><p>160. The Greeks played <em>pettoi, </em>a generic glass of games that involved throwing dice, moving players' pieces, and taking turns.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="161"><p>161. Literally, "the guy who paints funeral urns [<em>lekythoi</em>]." This may refer to an actual painter who specialized in <em>lekythoi</em>, or to Death himself, who inspires such paintings.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="162"><p>162. The original joke refers to the hook used to lower buckets into a well, and suggests throwing the old woman down instead.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="163"><p>163. Literally, "Today I will become Procrustes." Procrustes was Greek mythological figure who tortured his guests by stretching them or sawing them to fit a bed. Theseus killed him using the same method. The joke also plays on the Greek verb <em>pro-krouein</em>, "perform a preliminary banging" used above in the decree, neatly implying that the "prebanging" is equivalent to Procrustes' torture.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="164"><p>164. The hag refers to a law that states men are unable to handle transactions over the value of a <em>medimnos </em>(1.5 bushels of grain). This is the language of an actual Athenian law limiting women's ability to handle transactions; as such we have chosen to keep only the reversal and omit the specific quantities.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="165"><p>165. He threatens to claim he is a merchant (<em>emporos</em>); presumably he means a sea merchant, who were allowed to delay court cases in order to take advantage of fair sailing weather.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="166"><p>166. Originally, it's "Diomedian necessity" (<em>Diomêdeia anankê</em>), a saying that refers to Diomedes driving Odysseus in front of him with a sword. We have chosen to quote Winston Churchill to capture the well-known nature.</p></div>

              <div class="note" id="167"><p>167. In the original Greek the monster is called by her name, Empusa. She was a bogey-woman whose appearance could change from story to story.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="168"><p>168. Literally, "Heracles, Pans, Korybantes, and Dioscuri." Heracles is the famous Greek hero. Pan is the goat-footed god of the woods; though he occasionally appears in the plural (as here), he most often a singular deity, especially in the modern minset, and we used the singular form to avoid audience confusion. The Korybantes accompany the goddess Cybele. They, and Pan, may suggest the frenzied panic the young man feels. The Dioscuri are Castor and Polydeuces, sons of Zeus.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="169"><p>169. "You guys would make terribly good ferrymen --you'd grind your passengers by dragging them." As this joke relies on a cultural knowledge of ancient ferrying practices, we have chosen to change it entirely.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="170"><p>170. We have omitted a "by Zeus" and replaced it with a more common exclamation.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="171"><p>171. We have omitted the lead-in, "Just as in the matter of Cannonus's vote..." Nothing is known about the vote, and as such including it would not have added further meaning.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="172"><p>172. Some scholars take the toad (<em>phryn</em>ê<em>) </em>as a reference to an actual (and presumably unattractive) woman named Phryne. The toad is "swollen about the jaws", literally.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="173"><p>173. Literally "Thasian vintages". Thasian wine was known to be rich.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="174"><p>174. The serving maid literally says "pour the wine unmixed," which would confuse a modern listener. Ancient winemaking produced something more like a high-alcohol sour mash than our highly filtered modern wine, and this would usually be mixed with water. Drinking unmixed wine was a sign of excess or, as here, celebration.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="175"><p>175. Literally, "in the Cretan fashion." Cretan dancers were known for their skill and athleticism.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="176"><p>176. This term, a compound composed of many different parts, has the distinction of being the longest single word recorded in Greek. Some of the ingredients, such as the multiple species of fish and birds, suggest luxury, but others suggest more common fare. We have done our best to translate accordingly.</p></div> 

              <div class="note" id="177"><p>177. In the Greek, the final song ends with the repetition of the words <em>iai, evai, and evoi</em>, all of which are exclamations associated with the <em>komos</em>. Given that these exclamations do not have semantic content, we have have chosen to mirror a modern practice artists such as Regina Spektor, Rhianna, and Lady Gaga, repeating a syllable for rhythm.</p></div>
